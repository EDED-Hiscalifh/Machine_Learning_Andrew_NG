# Machine_Learning_Andrew_NG
Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

## Contents of Machine Learning Course
● Supervised Learning 
Supervised Learning is model which is given a data sets and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is arelationship between the input and the output.

1. Linear Regression
Linear Regression is model which there are some linear relation between feature and target value.

1) Simple Linear Regression
Single Linear Regression model is consisted of one feature and one targe varaible. We predict target variable with Hypothesis function H(x). And minimze Cost function J(theta), We can get more accurate model.

2) Multivariate Linear Regression


3) Polynomial Linear Regression
Polynomial Linear Regression is applied when distribution of feature has polynomail plot. 

4) Other non-linear Regression

2. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is model which predict discrete value 

1) Binary Logistic Regression

2) Multiple Logistic Regression


3. Neural Network
+Sliding windows : In photo detection problem, Make some frame (m x n) and send them through all the phto frame. And Train it for detection

4. Support Vector Machine


●Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning is model which approach problems with little or no idea what our result should look like and derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

1. K-Means Clustering 


2. Anomaly Detection

3. Recommend System

●Feature Scailing

1. Feature Normalization

2. PCA(Data compression)

3. Derivative Feature, Polynomial Feature

●Model Evaluation

1. Train - Test sets

2) Linear Regression : MSE, R2score
 
3) Logistic Regression : MSE(log loss), F2socre

2. Train - Cross validation - Test sets

3. High bias, High Variance

4. Skewed Error

## Finalizing
Through this course, i can get knowledge of what is machine learning, and what kind of alogirthm.
I also get some power to go further and deeper machine learning system.
